To deploy the application, follow this guide.

### Prerequisites

- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account.
- A [Neon](https://neon.tech/) account.

### 1. Setting up the Neon Database

1.  Create a new project on Neon.
2.  In your project's dashboard, go to the "Connection Details" section and copy the **PostgreSQL** connection string.
3.  Create the `notes` table by running the following SQL query in Neon's SQL editor:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE notes (
        id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
        text TEXT,
        image_url TEXT,
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
    );
    ```

### 2. Configuring and Deploying on Vercel

1.  Push your code to your GitHub repository.
2.  Go to your Vercel dashboard and click **"Add New... > Project"**.
3.  Import your GitHub repository (`homer-notes-app`).
4.  Vercel will automatically detect that it's a `Create React App` project.
5.  Navigate to the project's **Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**.
6.  Add a new environment variable:
    - **Name:** `DATABASE_URL`
    - **Value:** Paste the Neon connection string you copied earlier.
7.  Click **"Deploy"**. Vercel will handle the build and deployment process. Every push to the `main` branch will trigger a new deployment automatically.
